**Project vision:**

1. **Local first**
   No sign up required to use it freely, without lock-in.
2. **TypeScript & schema-focused**  
   Focus on modern TS with schema backends that allow static analysis.
3. **Code-native**
   Make endpoints easy to manage within editor, no need to learn GUI UI/UX.
4. **Focus on correctness**
   Showing nothing when result unpredictable, wrong result considered as bug.
5. **Easy and minimalistic UX**
   Ability to start with few clicks and remember less as possible, learn syntax on flow without docs.
6. **Sync resolution**
   Code define template, user intent override, user intent dominate.
7. **AI usage in project**
   Only at specific degree, not for docs. For logic possible but to make sure its semantically related, and not technical debt.
8. **Cloud vision**
   Optional brings features like monitoring, uptime or alerts.
