# WatchAPI Client

WatchAPI Client is a REST client for testing and managing API endpoints directly from VS Code.
It lets you organize endpoints into collections, send HTTP requests, and work with APIs without leaving your editor.

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-First Storage**: All collections and endpoints are stored locally in VS Code by default
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Login only if you want to sync data across devices or collaborate with teams
